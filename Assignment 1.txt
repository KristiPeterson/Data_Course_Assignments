Shell practice tasks:

1. For each of the filenames that begin with "M" in the directory 
"~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/pdb" list the number of lines in each file.
ls m*

2. Redirect the output from the previous task to a new file named "m_lines.txt" in 
"~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"
ls m* > "m_lines.txt"

3. For the file "animals.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/" get an alphabetical list 
of the unique animal types that were observed and redirect this list to "unique_animals.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"
~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data (master)
$ cut -d "," -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq

4. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/" there is a file named "BioLog_Plate_Data.csv"
Write a command that gives a list of the unique carbon substrates the biolog plate measured, 
and which saves this list as "unique_C-substrates.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/" 
$ cut -d "," -f 5 BioLog_Plate_Data.csv | sort | uniq > unique_C-substrates.txt

5. 
~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data (master)
$ wc -l *.txt  | sort -n |  tail -2 | head -1
3080 sunspot.txt

6. 

$ bash Sum_All_Lines.sh >> file_sums.txt

//here is my nano 
#!/bin/bash

ls */data/* > listing.txt

filename="listing.txt"

while IFS= read -r var
do
        bash ~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/scripts/sum_lines.sh $var
done < "$filename"
